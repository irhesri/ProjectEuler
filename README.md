# ProjectEuler+
___
__Project Euler__ is a collection of challenging __mathematical__ and __computational problems__ that require creative problem-solving skills to solve. These problems range in difficulty from relatively easy to extremely challenging, and they cover a wide range of topics, from number theory and combinatorics to graph theory and computational geometry.
<br/>
<br/>
The problems on Project Euler are designed to be tackled using computer programming, and many of them require efficient algorithms and data structures to be solved within a reasonable amount of time. As such, solving these problems not only requires mathematical insight but also programming skills.
